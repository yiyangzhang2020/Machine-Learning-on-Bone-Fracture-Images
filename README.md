# Machine-Learning-on-Bone-Fracture-Images(A Medical Image-processing library)

Machine learning is an efficient and powerful tool to achieve high accuracies on classification of medical diagnostic images.

Our group decided to develop a deep learning model to classify medical diagnostic images(X-ray) of patient's forearm bone fracture from those are not fractured.

The dataset we decided to use and train is from the bone X-Ray Deep Learning Competition of Stanford ML Group(https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/).

Our main tasks include:
1.Initial data cleaning and dataset selection to ensure appropriate train/test set sizes.
2.Select appropriate traning model and classification method.
3.Ensure a high accuracy of the traning model.

Each group member's task is yet to be discussed.
